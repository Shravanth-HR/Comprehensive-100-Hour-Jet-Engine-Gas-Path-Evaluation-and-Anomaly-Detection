# Comprehensive 100-Hour Jet Engine Gas Path Evaluation and Anomaly Detection
● Performed time-series analysis on 100 hours of simulated engine data to detect anomalies in pressure ratio, compressor  efficiency, and turbine temperature using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib). ● Engineered rolling averages, conditional flags, and statistical thresholds to identify surge precursors, overheat risks, and  performance degradation trends. ● Created multi-variable dashboards and correlation plots to visualize engine health metrics, enabling early warning  insights for predictive maintenance decisions.
